      <p><strong>Cats! Cats Cats!</strong></p>
      <p>Have you ever wondered about cats? Well this website is all about cats. Big cats. Brown cats. Fat cats. slow cats. If its a cat, it can and hopefully someday will be a part of this website.</p>
      <p>Most of the content from this site will come from the streets of Istanbul , where stray cats rule the roost.
</p>
      <p>In Istanbul, the cats are just as much of a landmark as the Hagia Sophia or Galata tower. Every member of the community looks out for the cats in some small way, often through local charitable foundations. One of the explanations behind Turkish reverence for cats is that they’re considered ritually clean creatures in Islam. In fact, cats are even referenced in the Hadith, a book of the actions and sayings of the Islam Prophet Muhammed. There’s a story that Muhammed cut off the sleeve of his robe, to avoid disturbing a cat who was napping on his clothing. </p>
      <p>Another story talks about a cat called Abu Hurayrah that saved the Prophet Muhammed from a deadly snake. In return for his thanks, the Prophet blessed the creatures with the ability to always land on their feet in return. They were also respected for guarding the city from mice, as well as rats, who carried diseases such as the plague.</p>
